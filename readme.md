# Design of Island-Bridge Electronics for High-precision 3D Deployment

Developed in collaboration with William Mangram from Stanford University.<br>

Based on and includes code from the simulation technique presented in "Texture Mapping Real-World Objects with Hydrographics" by<br>
Daniele Panozzo, Olga Diamanti, Sylvain Paris, Marco Tarini, Evgeni Sorkine, Olga Sorkine-Hornung presented at<br>

## Summary
As an extension to [ttopac/2d_islandbridge](https://github.com/ttopac/2d_islandbridge), this project studies the deployment of regular, non-uniform grid island-bridge electronics to specified targets on non-developable 3D surfaces. We attain an approach similar to hydrographic printing, where the target object is lowered towards a stretchable device that floats in a liquid. By simulating the expansion characteristics of serpentine interconnects and physics interactions between objects, an optimal device design that minimizes the deviation of nodes from target locations can be obtained. 

## Code
Work is in progress, and the code is not entirely functional at this time. Please reach out if you'd like to contribute.
